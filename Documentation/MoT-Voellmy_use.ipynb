    "## General features\n",
    "\n",
    "MoT-Voellmy is NGI's model for calculating the run-out of snow avalanches. It is a *continuum model*, i.e., the avalanche is treated as a (fluid) body rather than as just a point mass as in the block models. Thus, the length, width and thickness of the flow are variable both in space and time. The dynamical equations governing the flow are derived from the requirement that mass and momentum must be conserved (if erosion and deposition along the path and the external forces of gravity and friction are properly accounted for). All of this will be discussed in more detail during one of the lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"trick\" behind numerical continuum models is to discretize space and time into sufficiently small finite time steps, line segments (in 1D), subareas (in 2D) or elementary volumes (in 3D). This procedure reduces the number of degrees of freedom from infinite to a finite number, so that the fundamental equations no longer are partial differential equations but (usually highly non-linear) algebraic equations. These can be solved numerically on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many respects, MoT-Voellmy is similar to the widely used (commercial) code [RAMMS::AVALANCHE](./Christen_et_al.RAMMS.CRST_63_2010.pdf), but its numerics are simpler, which makes it very fast. Both programs do not solve the basic equations for the 3D velocity vector $(u, v, w)$ in 3D, but instead assume the flow to always follow the terrain surface. This makes it possible to reduce the equations to 2D equations for the slope-parallel *depth-averaged* velocity $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{v})$ and the flow depth (or flow thickness) $h$, which is measured perpendicular to the terrain. Thus, one loses all information about the variability of $u$ and $v$ in the direction normal to the terrain. On the upside, the computational effort is reduced by some two orders-of-magnitude. Knowledge of the depth-averaged velocity is sufficient in most practical applications, like hazard mapping or dimensioning of mitigation measures.\n",

    "In the folder `Test_case_MoT-Voellmy`, there is a file `Ryggfonn.qgz`. Open it in QGIS to visualize your simulation results (there may be a warning that some files wee not foundâ€”press the button `Browse` to find them. You can add additional layers to view intermediate snapshots of the avalanche descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to explore the code further, modify the RCF, save it under a different name and run it in a new cell. For example, to find out how the coefficient *k* affects the speed and run-out, choose another constant value for *k* or replace the values for *Âµ* and *k* by the names of the files contained in the same folder. MoT-Voellmy also allows modeling snow entrainment along the path. To see this in action, indicate the file names `RGF_1987-01-28_b0.asc`, `RGF_1987-01-28_tauc.asc` in lines 13 and 14, and set the value of `Entrainment` to `TJEM`. To study the effect of the fracture depth, you would need to modify the raster file `RGF_1987-01-28_h0.asc`, e.g., by loading the file into an editor and replacing all instances of \"1.0\" by some other fracture depth."
