## Example Simulations

This folder contains input data for sample simulations. At present, an avalanche observed on 2021-04-11 at NGI's full-scale test site Ryggfonn in Grasdalen (western Norway) is featured, but additional cases may be added by the developers or by users.

If QGIS is used for visualization, the files with names ending in .qgz can be opened directly. The .qml files define rendering styles, where `h` and `s` refer to flow or deposit depth and to speed, respectively. Next in the filename is the range in m or m/s, and then the number of intervals. These styles can easily be modified in QGIS by applying them to a data set, changing parameters under the menu points `Properties – Symbology` or `Properties – Transparency` and then saving them under a different, suitable name.

See the README files in the main directory of each case for further information.
