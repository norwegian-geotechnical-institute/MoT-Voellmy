Test runs with MoT-Voellmy v.2016-06-30, Jan./Febr. 2018
========================================================


The goal of these tests is to determine
  - whether MoT-Voellmy gives reliable results in simple situations,
  - whether MoT-Voellmy compares well with RAMMS,
  - how strong the grid-size dependence is at practical grid resoultions,
  - how strongly the centrifugal force affects the run-out distance,
  - how the results depend on the choice of CFL number,
  - and how strongly sideways propagation shortens the run-out distance.


1   Tests without earth pressure on a long uniform slope
    ----------------------------------------------------

01  gully_01.cmd

    Uses gully.asc, gully_01_h.asc (single-row release) to test that mass
    remains in place if μ > tan θ.
    
    Mass indeed remains in place and MoT-Voellmy reports avalanche as stopped.
    However, output of stopped mass is empty, needs fixing!

02  gully_02.cmd
    Uses gully.asc, gully_01_h.asc (single-row release) to test acceleration
    and terminal velocity for a quasi-mass point. The earth-pressure
    coefficient is set to 0.
    Slope angle θ = arctan(0.5)
